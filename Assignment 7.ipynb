    "# Smoothen Stock Price\n",
    "Write a function named `smoothen_price`. Given the historical stock price data (represented by a 1D numpy array) and a window size (an integer) as inputs, the function smoothens the stock price using a moving average filter. You can use the simple moving average filter. The function should plot the original stock price and smoothened stock price. Make sure your plot is clearly labeled. Do not use the built-in moving average filters. \n",
