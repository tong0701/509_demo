## Quick Start

Each project folder contains its own README.md with detailed instructions on how to run the solution. Please refer to the individual README files for:

- Problem descriptions
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Sample input and output

## Projects Overview

### 1. Tic Tac Toe Game

A command-line Tic Tac Toe game with support for human and AI players. Features include:
- Complete board implementation with `draw_board()` and `check_winner()` methods
- Unit tests for game logic
- Game data logging to CSV

**Location**: `tic_tac_toe/`

### 2. Linear Regression Toolkit

A reusable linear regression toolkit using NumPy with:
- Closed-form solution with optional L2 regularization
- Evaluation metrics (MSE, R²)
- Train/test split functionality
- Jupyter notebook with three experiments

**Location**: `linear_regression/`

### 3. Grid World Navigation

A grid world navigation system with:
- Position representation
- Grid world with walls, start, and goal
- Agent movement control
- BFS pathfinding algorithm

**Location**: `grid_world/`

## Dependencies

Each project has its own requirements. Common dependencies include:
- Python 3.7+
- NumPy (for linear regression)
- Matplotlib (for linear regression plotting)
- Jupyter (for linear regression notebook)

See individual project README files for specific requirements.
